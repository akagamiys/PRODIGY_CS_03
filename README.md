# Password Strength Checker

## Overview

This Python program assesses the strength of a given password using various criteria, including length, character variety, common patterns, and a detailed analysis provided by the zxcvbn library.

## Features

Length Check: Evaluates the password length and assigns points based on predefined thresholds.

Character Variety Check: Checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Common Pattern Check: Identifies common patterns or dictionary words within the password.

Detailed Analysis: Utilizes the zxcvbn library for a comprehensive password strength analysis.

Scoring System: Aggregates scores from all checks to determine the overall strength of the password.

## Requirements

-Python 3.x

-zxcvbn library

## How It Works

Length Check: Passwords of 12 or more characters receive the highest score, while those with 8-11 characters receive a moderate score.
    
Character Variety Check: The presence of both uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters increases the score.
    
Common Pattern Check: Passwords containing common patterns like "123", "password", "qwerty", etc., are penalized.

zxcvbn Analysis: This library provides a score from 0 to 4 based on a detailed analysis of the password's strength.

Overall Score and Strength: The total score is used to classify the password strength as "Very Strong", "Strong", "Moderate", or "Weak".

## Usage

Ensure Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries using pip.

Run the Program: Execute the Python script in your environment.

Input Password: Enter a password when prompted to check its strength.

View Results: The program will output the password strength and detailed analysis.

## Notes

Key Length: Ensure that the password length meets the security requirements for your specific use case.

Character Variety: Encourage using a mix of character types to enhance password strength.

Common Patterns: Avoid using common patterns or dictionary words.

Analysis Tool: The zxcvbn library provides a robust analysis, but combining it with additional checks can offer more comprehensive feedback.
